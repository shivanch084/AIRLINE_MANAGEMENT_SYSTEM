üßæ Project Description
The Airline Management System is a desktop-based Java application designed to automate core airline operations such as passenger registration, flight scheduling, and ticket reservations.
Developed using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and MySQL for data storage, the system enables seamless management of passenger and flight data in a structured and user-friendly manner.

This project allows airline staff to perform essential functions including adding new flights, registering customers, booking and canceling tickets, and viewing journey details. 
It eliminates the need for manual paperwork by maintaining digital records for all reservations and travelers. The system ensures accurate data storage and retrieval, supporting 
a more efficient and error-free process.

It focuses on three major modules:

Airlines & Flights

Employees/Admin

Customers/Passengers

Each module interacts with a central MySQL database, using JDBC for connectivity. The application is built in NetBeans IDE, following a modular, object-oriented design.
With a responsive and intuitive Swing-based UI, the system provides a real-time operational interface ideal for small-scale airline management or educational purposes.
